This is the Anon INU Contract as per BSCSCAN. This was downloaded and posted here in an unadulterated, unmodified view for all to see.

I have been following this cryptocurrency to discover if this was a rugpull or if it just had very bad luck, here is the information
about the token that I have discovered.

# Brief History / Anon Inu Story:
For those interested in understanding this currency:

It appears to of had a rogue developer who tried to rug pull money, when the other developers behind it seen this they did what they could to prevent it and then wipe their hands clean of it entirely.

"Joe" renounced the contract to cut ties, however after pressure from people who liked the coin he returned to it.

He also brought with him the secret 12 key pass to get access to a wallet with 370 trillion in AINU, this was held by the other developer (if you believe the story).

Now the community behind this coin is working to un-tarnish its name and rebuild itself, this includes new riddle/puzzles on the blockchain that yield BNB.

A new website overhaul, a new discord (official)

And a whole team behind it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
# My involvement
As a programmer I volunteered my time and have been working with the community to try and unravel the mysteries of this coin and its previous developers.

I am currently working to help market this coin by telling the story as we know it. But like all stories, I recommend caution. While I do work with
"Joe" and others that came to rally behind this coin, I still recommend using caution when buying crypto, no matter the kind of crypto.

I am being transparent here. I do not want to mislead anyone. This coin was burned by a rug-pull and is now community driven, but that does not mean it
cannot happen again. So when I say, use caution, I do in fact, mean it. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
# Rogue Developer
The rogue developer who tried to rug pull the money has since started from what we can tell, several new coins all using the Anon name with the intent to rug-pull
the communities more.

In the discord people rapidly report when they see his new attempts, he sticks to telegram groups mainly, posts information, drops a new coin, gets funded, and runs out
with the cash. People on Discord have taken to reporting everything that he is involved in before he has a chance to rug-pull anything.

He is based in the UK from my understanding and this trend of reporting him will not stop until he is arrested for stealing money or straight out stops being involved
in the development of cryptocurrencies. Which ever comes first.

# Future
While I am not developing this currency, only trying to understand it. I do know that people are genuinely involved with this currency and want the best for it.
There are many milestones ahead but if this coin can turn around over the next few years (as of Sept 2021) then this coin has a standing chance of being at least
something that the team behind it is intending it to be.
